Group 4 - Search for Suitable Houses

**Problem Statement**

Finding the right house location is increasingly difficult due to the need to balance three factors: distance to essential places, housing costs, and neighbourhood safety (crime rates). Affordable housing is usually located far from workplaces, while safer neighbourhoods and more convincing areas are typically more expensive. This creates a complex decision-making process for individuals and families. We chose this problem to provide a solution to help simplify the search by considering these factors together.
